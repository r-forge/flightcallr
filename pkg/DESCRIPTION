Description: flightcallr uses the seewave package to generate acoustic 
	measurements ("features") of sounds, and then trains and uses random 
	forest models to make predictions based on these features. Accuracy
	can be constrained via cross-validation. Convenience functions for
	reading and writing Raven selection tables are included.
